## The Debugger's Dilemma

### The Mysterious Bug

Liam was a seasoned Python developer. One day, he encountered a bug in his code that he couldn't quite pin down. His program, which processed data from a CSV file, kept crashing with a cryptic error message.

### The Investigation

Liam meticulously reviewed his code:

```python
import csv

def process_data(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        reader = csv.reader(file)
        for row in reader:
            print(row[1])
```

Everything seemed fine. The bug persisted, and Liam grew frustrated.

### The Eureka Moment

After hours of debugging, Liam had a realization. He added a simple check to handle empty rows:

```python
def process_data(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        reader = csv.reader(file)
        for row in reader:
            if len(row) > 1:
                print(row[1])
```

### The Victory

The program ran smoothly. Liam learned that even seasoned programmers must sometimes step back and approach problems from a new angle.
